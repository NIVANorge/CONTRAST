## About


[Zenodo](https://about.zenodo.org/) is an open-source repository used to archive and share any research data. A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is assigned to any file submitted, and all data are stored at the European Organization for Nuclear Research  [(CERN)](https://www.home.cern/).

This document intends to describe and provide what is needed for searching and uploading data on [CONTRAST community](https://zenodo.org/communities/contrast) in Zenodo. 

## Sign up/ Log in to Zenodo

| :------- | :----------- |
4. All uploaded files have tags identifying date uploaded, type of file, and type of access.|![](Images/uploaded_data.png){width=500px}|

**Description of tags:**

- Uploaded date: <span class="label label-info ng-scope ng-binding" style="background-color:#6aa3d5">Month,DD,YYY(version)</span>
- Type of file: <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #777">Dataset; Presentation; Poster, etc</span> 
- Type of access:
    - <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #5cb85c">Open</span> 
    - <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #f0ad4e">Embargoed</span> - The file will be given open access from a date specified by the publisher (the date can be changed after upload).
    - <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #d9534f">Restricted</span> - Access can be requested. Conditions for access can be given by the publisher.

## Before you start your upload

Please follow the **naming conventions**, **data types**, and **format guidelines** defined in the project’s **Data Management Plan (DMP)** whenever possible.  
The summary below provides key extracts from the DMP (_Chapter: Datasets_).  
For updates or clarification, always refer to the most recent version of the DMP.  

---

### Naming Conventions

Whenever possible, name your data files according to the following format:


`_WPnumber_TaskNumber_PartnerAcronym_Easy-to-understand-content_date_`

**Example:**

`_WP5_T5.3_NIVA_Bioassay-CampaignXX-sediment_14.03.2024_`

This structure helps ensure clarity, traceability, and alignment across project partners.



### Main Deliverable Types

| **Type of Data** | **Characteristics** | **Possible Formats** |
|------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Chemical and physicochemical data** | Concentrations of CECs and legacy contaminants in different matrices; physicochemical properties such as temperature, salinity, oxygen, suspended particle matter (SPM), and dissolved organic matter (DOM). | **Recommended:** `.csv`, `.tab`<br>**Accepted:** `.xls`, `.xlsx` |
| **Biological data** | Information regarding living organisms, encompassing genomics (and other omics data), physiological parameters, and related aspects (e.g., field, lab, mesocosm). | **Recommended:** `.csv`, `.tab`<br>**Accepted:** `.xls`, `.xlsx` |
| **Computational data** | Data produced by computer simulations, modelling, algorithms, or software applications (e.g., model outputs). | **Recommended:** NetCDF<br>**Also:** [Upload the corresponding GitHub repository to Zenodo](https://help.zenodo.org/docs/github/enable-repository/) |
| **Reports / Policy briefs / Workshops** | Scientific reports, workshop abstracts, policy briefs, internal documents, and similar outputs. | **Recommended:** Open Document Format (`.odf`)<br>**Accepted:** `.pdf`, `.html`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.rtf` |

## Uploading files


| | |
| :------- | :----------- |
|- Click on <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #5cb85c">New upload</span> |![](Images/upload_btn.png)|
|- Ensure that the community is selected to submit your record. If you see the community logo on the top of the upload section, [jump here](#jump-com-upload).  |![](Images/upload_selected_community.png)|
|- If it is not, click on <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #357ebd">Select a community</span> on the top the upload section.| ![](Images/upload_community.png)|
|- Search for CONTRAST and click on _Select_.| ![](images/upload_select_community.png)|
|- <a name="jump-com-upload"></a> Upload your file(s) by either drag and drop or by clicking on <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #357ebd">Upload files</span>.|![](Images/Upload_files_btn.png)|
- Choose the visibility of your upload. If you choose <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #5cb85c">Public</span>, your file will be open source. if you choose <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #d9534f">Restricted</span>, the files will be only accessible by users specified in the permissions.| ![](Images/upload_visibility.png)|
It is also possible to apply an embargo| ![](Images/upload_vis_embargo.png)|
- Most fields on the _Basic Information_ section are required (marked with <span style = "color: red">*</span>).|![](Images/Upload_information.png)|
- Once you are ready to submit, click on <span class="label label-info ng-scope ng-binding" style="background-color:#357ebd">Submit for review</span>. It is also possible to save a draft.| ![](images/upload_send_for_review.png)|
- Once your upload is completed, it will be searchable on Zenodo, but not yet connected to the CONTRAST community. A curator (community owner) will receive your request to include your file in the community repository and approve it if the community requirements are fulfilled (if any).||
- You can find all your uploads (including drafts) by clicking on _My dashboard_ on the top banner.|![](Images/your_uploads.png)|

## Uploading datasets

- Make sure to name the file according to CONTRAST's DMP

- Make sure to add a description about the dataset (raw file, quantitative/qualitative data, link to article, etc).

- Whenever possible, upload your datasets in .csv format. .csv files are supported by a wide range of software applications than Excel, making it more accessible. They are also lighter due to its simplicity (lacking of formatting).

- Tag your data with file type  <span class="label label-default ng-binding" style = "background-color: #777">Dataset</span> . This will make your file easier to find.

- It is possible to upload your dataset together with other materials, but it is preferable to upload it on its own. This is to ensure your data are findable when searching for datasets. In this case you will want to link it to your publication: 
    -	go to the publication, click on Edit, and fill out the field Related works.
